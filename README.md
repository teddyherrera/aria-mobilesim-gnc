# GNCProject

Originally developed in Python for a graduate survey course on guidance, navigation, and control,
this waypoint-following project uses a Kalman filter for position/velocity estimation, integrates
with MobileSim for robot simulation, and uses ARIA for robot hardware integration. It was first used
on a Pioneer3 robot, then translated to C++ to practice building a full C++ project. The program
follows a sequence of waypoints using a control law driven by a Kalman state estimate. It logs
telemetry to CSV, and a Python script generates plots and error distributions.

## Prerequisites
Install these vendor tools before building or running:
- ARIA (Adept MobileRobots ARIA SDK): http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/Aria
- MobileSim (robot simulator): http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/MobileSim
- Mapper3 / Mapper3D (map authoring tools): http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/Mapper3

## Repository Structure
- `src/` C++ entrypoint and main loop
- `include/` headers (Kalman filter, Robot Actions, helpers)
- `data/` waypoint list and data logging files
- `scripts/` Python plotting and analysis
- `third_party/` Eigen (used for developing the Kalman filter helper)
- `build/` local build artifacts (not required)

## Dependencies
### C++ / Build
- CMake >= 3.20
- ARIA SDK (set `-DARIA_ROOT`)
- Eigen (vendored in `third_party/eigen-5.0.1`)

### Python
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`, `filterpy`

Install Python deps:
```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Build (Windows / MSVC)
```cmd
cd path\to\project\build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio <version>" -A Win32 -DARIA_ROOT="C:\Program Files\MobileRobots\Aria"
cmake --build . --config Release
```


## Run
Run the C++ program from `..\build`:
```cmd
.\Release\follow_wp_kfposvel.exe ..\data\waypoint_list.txt ..\data\log.csv
```

## Plot / Analyze
Activate your virtual environment and run plotting from the repository root. Plots are saved to the
current working directory.
```cmd
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python scripts\plot_wp_kfposvel.py data\waypoint_list.txt data\log.csv
```

## Quick Reference
- Build (Windows/MSVC): `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio <version>" -A Win32 -DARIA_ROOT="C:\Program Files\MobileRobots\Aria"`
- Run: `.\Release\follow_wp_kfposvel.exe ..\data\waypoint_list.txt ..\data\log.csv`
- Plot: `python scripts\plot_wp_kfposvel.py data\waypoint_list.txt data\log.csv`


## Data Inputs and Outputs
- Input: `data/waypoint_list.txt`
- Output: `data/log.csv` (pose, estimate, control, error terms)

## Kalman Filter (FilterPy -> C++ Adaptation)
This implementation is adapted from the FilterPy Python library into a C++/Eigen
implementation. Key mapping:
- State vector, `F`, `H`, `Q`, `R` follow the same structure as FilterPy
- Predict/update are implemented with Eigen matrix math
- Tuning and numerical stability adjustments are documented in code comments

If you modify the model, keep the state definition consistent between the C++
filter and the Python analysis scripts.

## Control Laws
The controller is split into a waypoint-following yaw controller and a speed
controller, both driven by the Kalman filter estimate.

- **Cross-track geometry and reference frame**: the local path frame uses a
  Parallel Transport (P-T) frame [1]. For a segment from `(x1, y1)`
  to `(x2, y2)`, define the tangent `t = [dx, dy] = [x2 - x1, y2 - y1]` and a
  90-degree clockwise normal `n_cw = [dy, -dx]`. Using the normal as the line
  coefficients, in [2], gives `a = n_x`, `b = n_y`, `c = -(a x1 + b y1)`, so the
  cross-track error is the signed distance to `ax + by + c = 0`, saturated to
  +/-1 m.
- **Heading error**: desired heading is the line direction
  `heading_ref = atan2(a, -b)`. Current heading is estimated from velocity,
  `heading_cur = atan2(vy, vx)`. The wrapped heading error is
  `e_psi = wrap(heading_ref - heading_cur)`.
- **Yaw control (rotational velocity)**: two PID loops act on lateral and
  heading error, summed as
  `u = u_lat + u_head`, then saturated to ±`maxRotVel`.
- **Waypoint switching**: when the distance to the next waypoint is below
  `wpThreshold_m`, the next segment becomes active.
- **Speed control**: translational speed is reduced as lateral/heading errors
  grow using multiplicative attenuation factors, then clamped to
  `[minSpeed, maxSpeed]`.

Key gains live in `include/Actions.h` and can be tuned via the PID controllers.

## Results / Plots
Example outputs:
- `kfposvel_analysis.png`
- `kfposvel_error_distributions.png`

## Troubleshooting
- ARIA not found: verify `-DARIA_ROOT` points to the ARIA install directory
- DLL issues: ensure `Aria.dll` is available in `ARIA_ROOT\BIN`
- Python import errors: activate `.venv` and install `requirements.txt`

## What I'd Do Differently Next Time
- Separate interfaces for hardware vs simulation implementation
- Write a more agnostic Kalman filter class that takes vector/matrix dimensions instead of hardcoding
  them
- Use an EKF to implement basic SLAM and obstacle avoidance logic
- Provide a parameter file for tuning rather than hardcoding PD gains
